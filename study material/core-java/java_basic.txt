Indentifier
-----------------
indentifier is a name in java program used to indentify a java component like class,variable,methods etc.

rules for indentifier
-----------------------
1. allowed character A-Z, a-z , 0-9 ,$ , _(underscore) , accept allowed character if we take any other character then
   compile time error.
2. indentifier name should not be start with digits. (start with A-Z , a-z ,$ ,_) but recomanded to use
   A-Z or a-z.
3. any keyword can not be used as indentifier but keyword can be used as part of indentifier.
4. the nam eof indentifier can be of any length but recomanded to use with in 16 character.
5. indentifier nam eshould be meaning full so that all the member of that project can understand the code.



Java Keyword
------------------
keyword is some word reserved in java for better writing of programm. the all keyword have a fixed meaning 
in java programm, in whole life time of programm we can not change the menaing of keyword


abstract	continue	for	new	switch
assert***	default	goto*	package	synchronized
boolean	do	if	private	this
break	double	implements	protected	throw
byte	else	import	public	throws
case	enum****	instanceof	return	transient
catch	extends	int	short	try
char	final	interface	static	void
class	finally	long	strictfp**	volatile
const*	float	native	super	while


note- true,false,null are called reserve value, mean they can be used as a value to variable.

why java is called compiled and interpretted programming language ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
because to execute a java programm first the programm need to compile then interprete thats why java is known as 
both compiled and interpreted programming language.


Data types in java
------------------------
To store and process the relevent data or information java providing a bunch of data type to store and work
with different different data like number,string,boolean etc.

data types are two types 1>primitive 2>non-primitive data/derived data

primitive data
--------------------
the data we can no break into multiple sub unit called primitive data , 
mean primitive data is the smallest unit of information.

non primitive data
-------------------
the we can break into multiple smallest sub unit value called non primitive data. In other word non primitive
data is the collection of primitive data.

"Hello" is a String type non primitive data can be break into multiple sub unit - 'H','e','l','l','o'


Variable
---------------
Variable is a conteiner or indentifier to reserve some memory and store the value in that memory.
variable has 3 property that is name,  type, value.

Syntax -  1. <dataType> <variableName>=<value>; declaration and initialization of variable
          2. <dataType> <variableName>;  decleration of variable
             <variableName>=<value>;     initialization of variable

Types of variable
------------------------
1. primitive variable
    the variable holding primitive data called primitive variable
2. non-primitive or reference variable
    the variable holding non primitive data called non primitive variable or reference variable
3. local variable
    The variable declared inside one method or block called local variable
4. static variable
    The variable declared inside class outside of method with static keyword called staic variable
5. non-static variable
    The variable declared inside class outside of method with out static keyword called non-staic variable


Litrals
---------
One constant value assigned to a varibale called litrals.
int a=10;
double d=10.5;
String s="jspider";

Note-
---------
when we store some non primitive value to a variable , internally the value stored in some places in memory and the variable 
contains the address of the value.

java operators
-------------------
Arithmatic operators- +,-,*,/,%


why java is called strictly types programming language
----------------------------------------------------------
any variable declared by programmer must be have one primitive or non primitive data types that why java is called strictly
types programming language. otherwise we will get compile time error.


Defining non primitive data
-------------------------------
* when the information inside object or entity is different object to object like name,roll,marks of students then take the 
  variable as non static 
* when the onformation inside object or entity is common or same like university name for students then take the variable as 
  static 
* for non static variable each time during object creation saperate copy of non static variable will create in heap memory.
* for static variable only one copy of memory will create and will shared by all objects
* non primitive data mainly defining by using class.

Assignment operator
------------------------
int i=10;
String s="jspider"; = is known as simple assignment operator

+=,-=,*=,/=,%=  complex assignment operator

String concat operator
---------------------------
+ can be used as string concat operator mean merge of two string.

Any data+ string= String;
String + Any data =String;
String + String =String 

relational operator(used to comare the values)
---------------------
< less then, <= less then or equal to 
> greater then , >= greater then or equal
== double equal , != not equal

the return type of comparision operator is boolean true or false

logical operator
-------------------
the disadvantage of comparision operator is at a time we can compare only one condition
at a time , to avoid that disadvantage java provides logical operator that is combination of
multiple comparision at a time

types - logical and(&&),logical or(||) , logical not(!)

logical and(&&)
-------------------
when all condition need to be true at a time then logical and is mandatory,
when all conditions are true then only logical and going to return true otherwise
returns false.

logical or(||)
-------------------
when any one condition among all posiible condition need to be true at a timem then 
programmer used logical or operator , logical or returns true if any one condition is
true and returns false when all condition is false at a time.
logical not
------------
it is a unary operator which is going to alter the boolean result
!true-----> false
!false----> true

unary operator- the operator performs operation on single operand called unary operator
                eg- !, ++ ,--.
binary operator- the operator performs operation on two operands called binary operator
                eg +,-,*,% etc.
turnery operator- the operator performs operation on three operand called turnery operator
                  eg - conditional operator( ?:)

increment and decrement operator
-----------------------------------
during programm execution when needed for increse or decrese the value of a variable by one
that time increment and decrement operator used . this is unary operator
*** This operator only works on variable not on litrals value.

pre increment- first increment the value of the variable then use.
post increment- first use the value of the variable then increment the value.

pre decrement- first decrement the value of the variable then use.
post decrement- first use the value of the variable then decrement the value.


switch
------------
it is just an extended version of else- if ladder
mean combination of multiple block in other way

Syntax
----------
switch(data /variable/ expression)
{
  case 1:
        code
        break;
  case 2:
        code
        break;
  case 3:
        code
        break;
        .
        .

 case n:
        code
        break;
 default:
        code
        break;
}



note- 1.the break and default statemnt is optional
      2. the allowed data in switch is byte,shrot,int,char and their wrapper classes along with String

note: 1. the switch will compare the given data with each case and the matched case will execute .
      2. if the given data not matched with any cases then the dafault block will exceute if present
      3. if we remove the break; then the mached case will get take next case also ,till meet with next break or
         the switch block ends.


Dynamic input
----------------------
During program execution the input given by users called dynamic input . By using dynamic input we can get two benifit
avoid recompile the programm while change the input and can take input during programm execution during run time.

For dynamic input one predefined class used that is Scanner class present in java.util package.
before using Scanner class the java.util package need to be include in programm . for that import statement is  used
eg - import java.util.*; // now we can use all the classes inside util package

Scanner class objecrr creation for dynamic input:
-------------------------------------------------
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

different types of input taking
------------------------------------
                int n=sc.nextInt();
		byte b= sc.nextByte();
		short s=sc.nextShort();
		long l=sc.nextLong();
		float f=sc.nextFloat();
		double d=sc.nextDouble();
		boolean b2=sc.nextBoolean();
		String s2=sc.next(); // or sc.nextLine();
		char c= sc.next().charAt(0);

              sc in above example is Scanner class object

nested dession making statement
------------------------------------
inside one decission making statement we can put any numbers of deission making statement with out problem, this is known as 
nested decission making statement.

eg - if{
         if/if-else/else-if ladder / switch
        }

 Iterative or looping statement
----------------------------------
when a line or group of code need to execute again and again , then this type of statements called iterative ststements in java
there are three iterative statements in java
1. for-loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop

for loop
--------
when a group of statememnt need to execute again and again but programmer know the iteration times then for loop used.

syntax-

for(initialization ; condition ; updation)
{
   //loop body or statements
}

initialization indicates the starting condition of loop
condition indicates the end of loop
updation indicates the each time steps need to cover

while loop
----------
when a group of statements need to executes again and again but the programmer do't know the execution time then while loop used.

syntax
----------

initialization
while(condition)
{
  //loop body
  //updation
}

if the programmer not used correct updation then loop might go into infinite loop


do- while
-----------
when a loop body need to execute atleast one time irrespective of condition true or false then the programmer need to use
do-while loop

syntax
---------
initialization
do {

  //loop body
  //updation

}while(condition);


* First one time loop body will execute without checking condition .
* After execute loop body one time the contion will check for second time execution permission.


Default value
----------------
when a static ,non static variable not assigned with any value then jvm(java virtual machine) going to assign some default value 
to that variable.
Default value only asigned to class level variable(static and non static). Default value not applicable to local variable
Before use any local variable the programmer need to assign the local variable explisitly otherwise compile time error.


data type                their-default value
---------------------------------------------
byte---------------------> 0
short--------------------> 0
int ---------------------> 0
long --------------------> 0
float--------------------> 0.0
double ------------------> 0.0
boolean -----------------> false
char --------------------> '\u0000' (null character)
Any non primitive -------> null


Method
----------------
writine all the codes inside main method is reduces code readability. thats why method concept is used.


Definition
-------------
set of instruction in a block used to perform some specific task , the method used to execute when some other method call
the desired method. The method breaks one complex logic into small small sub logic and reduce the complexity. 
Therefore the mofication of code become easy and feasible

Syntax
-------------
access_modifier modifier return_type name(arguments or parameters)
{
    //method body
}

where we can declare a method
------------------------------
inside a class ,interface we can declare a method. declaring mean creating one method.

* untill programmer call the method the method is not going to execute. to execute the method it it mandatory to call the method.

caller/source method
-----------------------
the method calling other methods caller caller or source method

called/ destination method 
------------------------------
the method calling by other method is known as called or destination method

* after defining onen method we can reuse the method as much we can , mean reusability is possible


Adavntages of methods
----------------------
1. one big complex problem can be broke into multiple small sub problem and solve.
2. reusability of code.
3. increse readability of code

types of methods as per availability
--------------------------------------
1. user defined method
------------------------
the method declared by programmer and also used by programmer is called user defined method.

2. predefined or library methods
----------------------------------
The method created by java library developers and used by programmer when it needed is called predefined method.


types of method as per argument or parameter
------------------------------------------------
1. no argument method
------------------------
when the method not accepting any data from caller method that type of method calling no argument method. no argument mean empty
braces() method

2. method with argument
------------------------
when the method accepting some data from caller methods while call the method that is called argument.
Syntax
----------
 publi cstatic voidd m1(int a) // the method m1() takes int data while call the method
{

  // method body
}

the variable accepting argument working as local variable to that method mean outside of that method we can not access the variable.


formal argument
---------------------
during method declaration the argument specifying by programmer with data type is called formal argument

actual argument
-----------------
during method call the value passed by programmer is called actual argument.

Note- during method call the formal argument and the actual argument sequence should be same otherwise compile time error.
      the parameter used as passing data while call a method from caller method to called memthod.




                         Return value
----------------------------------------------------------------------
after executing the method , the called method may return some value to caller method is known as retuern value, the return value may 
be primitive or non primitive . to return value programmer used the keyword return .

the return value and the return type declared with method should be same , otherwise compile time error

as per return value the methods are of two types 1. method without return value.
                                                 2. methods with return value

the method prefixed with void keyword in place of return type, those methods are known as method with out return value.


as per scope the methods are of two type 1. static method
                                         2. non static method.

static method
----------------------
the method which is declared with prefix static keyword called as static method also known as class level methods. 
to call static method Object creation is not mandatory. Programmer can call static method in 3 way
                               a/ by using className.methodName(); (recomanded)
                               b/ directly call by name inside same class
                               c/ by using objecr referece (not recomanded)

non static method
------------------------
the method which is not declared with prefix static keyword called as non static method also known as Object level methods.
the only way to call the method is objectreference.methodName() .
without creating object we can not call the non static method. if programmer used any other approache to call the non static method
then it will throw one compile time error.

native method
-------------
the method which is developed in some other programming language but used in java , that type of method known as native method.


                                                flow control staments
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
there are three flow control statements  break, continue, return

break
------------------
break is a flow control statement used to terminate any types of loop under a certain condition, once the break statement executes 
then next iteration will not execute.

continue
-----------
continue is a flow control statement used to skip the execution , once the continue executes it not breaks the loop , it just
avaoid current loop execution.


                                                nested loop
                                       ----------------------------------
loop inside another loop is known as nested loop .
in nested loop if the outer loop is going to execute x times and inner loop going to execute y timems then total number of execution
of inner loop statements is x*y times . mean for one time outer loop execution y times innter loop going to execute
